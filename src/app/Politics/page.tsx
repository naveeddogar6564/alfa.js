      Pakistan's politics is a dynamic and often turbulent arena, shaped by its unique history, diverse population, and regional complexities. Since gaining independence in 1947, the country has alternated between civilian democratic governments and military rule, reflecting ongoing challenges in establishing consistent democratic institutions.

The political landscape is dominated by several major parties, including the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), led by former Prime Minister Imran Khan, the

These parties represent different regional and ideological interests, with PTI promoting anti-corruption and governance reforms, PML-N traditionally focusing on development, and PPP being historically aligned with progressive policies.

Military influence plays a significant role in Pakistan's politics. <img className="w-30 h-30 md:w-30 md:rounded-non mx-auto" src="/Army cheif.jpeg" alt="" width="384" height="512"/> with the country experiencing several military coups, the last of which ended in 2008. Civilian-military relations continue to be a critical aspect of governance.

Issues such as economic instability, corruption, and terrorism have been major concerns, influencing both domestic policies and international relations. Despite these challenges, Pakistan has seen periods of democratic stability, with efforts to strengthen the judiciary, media, and civil society contributing to its evolving political landscape.
